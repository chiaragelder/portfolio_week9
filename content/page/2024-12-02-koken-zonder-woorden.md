This is the second assignment for Inge's atelier, we were tasked
  with turning a written recipe into a visual one by illustrating each step. We started by creating storyboards and, each week, drew out the steps, ensuring it was clear what was happening. The depiction of actions was particularly important in this process. I also combined multiple steps of the recipe to ensure the final visual guide had no more than 16 steps in total. This approach streamlined the workflow while maintaining clarity and instructional value.

  I was really looking forward to this assignment. I had seen it during the open house, and it already seemed like a lot of fun to create. Now that I’ve finally made it myself, I’m proud that I actually succeeded.

The best part of this assignment was that I got to use Illustrator a lot, and now I have a better understanding of how it all works. Coloring was a challenge—I tried both digital and manual methods. I quickly realized that digital coloring wasn’t my thing.
