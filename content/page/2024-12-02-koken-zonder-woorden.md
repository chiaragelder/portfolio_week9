description: This is the second assignment for Inge's atelier, we were tasked
  with turning a written recipe into a visual one by illustrating each step.

We started by creating storyboards and, each week, drew out the steps, ensuring it was clear what was happening. The depiction of actions was particularly important in this process. I also combined multiple steps of the recipe to ensure the final visual guide had no more than 16 steps in total. This approach streamlined the workflow while maintaining clarity and instructional value.
