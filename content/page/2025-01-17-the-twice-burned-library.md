*Leuven's library, a place of great knowledge and therefore a treasure trove of information, has unfortunately burned down twice. Both times it was, of course, rebuilt after long renovations. Richard Ovenden has written a beautiful historical text that describes the two fires and the events surrounding them. We were commissioned to turn this text into a book. Here were completely free, which meant that we did not have to take into account conditions such as budget, color palette, publisher,...*

I really enjoyed working on this assignment. However, as with every task, you sometimes run into challenges. For me, it was creating the cover. This took a while since I was working with photos. In general, this is not one of my strong suits, especially editing photos. I also had to redo the hardcover multiple times (read: 10 times…). But hey, difficult doesn’t mean impossible! Other than that, things went pretty well overall. I had to adjust the composition of the text a few times, but nothing out of the ordinary. All in all, I’m happy and proud that this is the final result.
