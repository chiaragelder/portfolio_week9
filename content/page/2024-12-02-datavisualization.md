For this assignment from Johan, we need to document our activities
  over the course of a week, including what we do, with whom, and for how long. This data will serve as the foundation for later analysis and will need to be visualized in two different ways: by time and by location. This approach encourages us to gain deeper insights into our daily routines and patterns. By translating this raw data into visual representations, we can better understand how we allocate our time and where we spend it. Ultimately, this exercise will lead to the creation of our first comprehensive data visualization using a self-generated dataset.

  This assignment was very educational and taught me a lot about collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data. Collecting the data went very smoothly. The challenging part for me was turning it into something visual. I struggled for quite a while trying to figure out how to transform my data into a clear and organized visual language. But once I got into it and found a direction, I was on a roll.

For a first time working with data, I’m very happy with the result. I showed my visualization to several people, and they understood it and could identify the trends, which made me very pleased. Additionally, it was an interesting exercise for myself as well. I learned that I spend a lot of time—and enjoy being—at home, that I’m not a night owl, and that I was generally happy that week.

Even though we had to complete this assignment in a very short time, I’m proud of my final result.
