For this assignment from Johan, we need to document our activities over the course of a week, including what we do, with whom, and for how long. This data will serve as the foundation for later analysis and will need to be visualized in two different ways: by time and by location. This approach encourages us to gain deeper insights into our daily routines and patterns. By translating this raw data into visual representations, we can better understand how we allocate our time and where we spend it. Ultimately, this exercise will lead to the creation of our first comprehensive data visualization using a self-generated dataset.
