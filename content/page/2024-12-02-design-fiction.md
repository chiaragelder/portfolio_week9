For Simon's assignment, we were tasked with identifying a problem related to time. I chose the question: "How can I make my nails dry faster?" Following this, we conducted a brainstorming session aimed at generating 50 potential solutions. This exercise led to some creative and unconventional ideas, including the concept of "DNA in your nails." The idea sparked intriguing discussions about incorporating biological enhancements or materials that could speed up the drying process. The brainstorming session not only expanded our thinking but also highlighted innovative and unexpected approaches to solving everyday time-related challenges.
