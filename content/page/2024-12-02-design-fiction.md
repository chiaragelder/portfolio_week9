description: "For Simon's assignment, we were tasked with identifying a problem
  related to time. I chose the question: \"How can I make my nails dry faster?\"
  Following this, we conducted a brainstorming session aimed at generating 50
  potential solutions. This exercise led to some creative and unconventional
  ideas, including the concept of \"DNA in your nails.\" The idea sparked
  intriguing discussions about incorporating biological enhancements or
  materials that could speed up the drying process. The brainstorming session
  not only expanded our thinking but also highlighted innovative and unexpected
  approaches to solving everyday time-related challenges."

My infographic is divided into three parts. The first part explains how DNA functions in your nails and presents the solutions I have found for this problem. The second part is a visual representation of how this would work within the human body. Finally, the last part informs about the societal impact, illustrating how it could lead to a division of society into classes.
