For this assignment for Inge, we need to go out and carefully observe our surroundings, with a focus on observing color. We should take a good camera with us and capture photos of beautiful or interesting colors. We also need to pay attention to how we photograph these colors, as composition is very important. Once we have selected the best photos (10), we will need to recreate those colors using acrylic paint. The colors should be painted in proportion to how they appear in the photo on our "sample." The goal is to create a personal view of the environment I live in, and how I perceive colors will also have an impact on this. The medium in which we present it is up to us, but it must clearly index the colors we’ve mixed. This will further illustrate how I perceive the colors in my surroundings. Additionally, the original photo must be incorporated into the medium. Lastly, we need to add a small piece of text describing our feelings about the colors or the place where the photo was taken.
