*This is the first assignment for Inge's atelier. We were tasked with photographing our culinary lives and providing insight into who we are as individuals. Each week, we had to take 100 photos. Afterwards, we selected 30 of them, which we then had to process in a medium of our choice.* after we had taken photos and then also a selection of the 30 best photos, we had to put this in an appropriate medium. I chose to make a poster. This poster shows a food vending machine as we know it from febo in the Netherlands. In it I have incorporated my photos. I am half Belgian and half Dutch. I wanted to show this in my work by also working with typical Dutch food. For example, you can see a croquette sandwich and the delft plates.
