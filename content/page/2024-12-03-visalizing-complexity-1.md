***Medal-Winning Ages in Olympic History***



*For this assignment, we were given several datasets about the Olympics. With these datasets I went to work and made a selection of the available data. Based on this selection, we formulated several questions that can be answered by studying the data visualization.*

*I chose to work with the ages and genders of the athletes. In my visualization you should be able to infer who is the youngest/oldest, female/male, of the sport Athletics for example. But you can also infer the average age for each sport that won a medal.*

I am very happy and proud of the final result. In the beginning, things were a bit challenging, but that taught me how I could approach it differently and better next time. This includes thinking more carefully about the questions upfront and finding the right data to match them, which isn’t always possible.

I also learned a bit about how to work with Excel, as I used to completely avoid that program. Once I had the right data and everything in place, things went much more smoothly, and it was mostly about fine-tuning the details.
