***Medal-Winning Ages in Olympic History***



*For this assignment, we were given several datasets about the Olympics. With these datasets I went to work and made a selection of the available data. Based on this selection, we formulated several questions that can be answered by studying the data visualization.*

*I chose to work with the ages and genders of the athletes. In my visualization you should be able to infer who is the youngest/oldest, female/male, of the sport Athletics for example. But you can also infer the average age for each sport that won a medal.*
